This command would normally launch an interactive dashboard that visualizes:
- Current specifications in \`openspec/specs/\`
- Active changes in \`openspec/changes/\`
- Archived changes in \`openspec/archive/\`
- Relationships between specs and changes
- Progress indicators for ongoing work

Features would include:
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Search functionality
- Detailed views of individual specs/changes
- Status indicators for each item

Note: This is a placeholder implementation. Full functionality will be implemented in a future release.`,
