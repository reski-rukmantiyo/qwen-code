# OpenSpec Integration

**Feature: OpenSpec Integration for Spec-Driven Development**

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**Goal:** Integrate OpenSpec (https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) to enable deterministic, spec-driven development workflows in Qwen Code. This provides structured human-AI collaboration where specifications are defined before implementation, reducing ambiguity and improving code quality.

**Overview:**
OpenSpec is a specification-driven development tool that prevents unpredictable AI outputs by ensuring humans and AI align on detailed specifications before any code changes. It maintains "truth" specifications in `openspec/specs/` and proposed changes in `openspec/changes/`. Qwen Code has a native OpenSpec integration that provides seamless specification-driven development workflows through the `/openspec` command.

**Workflow Integration:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize in project: `/openspec init`
   - This creates the `openspec/` directory structure in the project root
   - No separate global installation required as OpenSpec is integrated into Qwen Code

2. **Spec Phase:**
   - Create detailed specifications using `/openspec spec create` or modify existing ones with `/openspec spec edit`
   - Create change proposals with `/openspec change <change-name>`
   - Review and validate changes with `/openspec validate <change-name>`
   - View changes with `/openspec show <change-name>`
   - Specifications define exactly what needs to be implemented

3. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Qwen Code automatically reads specifications from `openspec/changes/` and `openspec/specs/`
   - AI implements tasks according to spec constraints using the structured tasks in `tasks.md`
   - Reduces scope creep through explicit requirements and implementation tasks

4. **Review Phase:**
   - Archive completed changes: `/openspec archive <change-name>`
   - Compare against original specifications for quality assurance
   - List active changes with `/openspec list`

5. **Integration with Qwen Code CLI:**
   - New command: `/openspec` with subcommands to interact with OpenSpec features
   - Automatic spec reading before major code changes through `OpenSpecMemoryIntegration`
   - Workflow enforcement for complex tasks with structured change proposals
   - Real-time file watching with `OpenSpecWatcherService` to detect specification changes

**Benefits:**
- Deterministic AI behavior through explicit specifications
- Better suited for brownfield development (evolving existing codebases)
- Improved PR handling and rebasing workflows
- Enhanced code quality through structured reviews
- Prevention of implementation drift from original intent

**Implementation Details:**
- OpenSpec functionality implemented as native Qwen Code commands (no external CLI dependency)
- Deep integration into core AI decision-making loop through `OpenSpecMemoryIntegration` service
- New UI components for spec visualization including interactive dashboard with `/openspec view`
- File watching system integration with `OpenSpecWatcherService` for real-time updates
- Caching system with `OpenSpecCacheService` for improved performance
- Build process automatically initializes OpenSpec context when present
- Testing framework includes unit tests for all commands and services
- Code conformance validation ensures AI outputs match specifications
