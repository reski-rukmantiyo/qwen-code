# OpenSpec Integration

**Feature: OpenSpec Integration for Spec-Driven Development**

**Status:** IMPLEMENTING

**Goal:** Integrate OpenSpec (https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) to enable deterministic, spec-driven development workflows in Qwen Code. This provides structured human-AI collaboration where specifications are defined before implementation, reducing ambiguity and improving code quality.

**Overview:**
OpenSpec is a specification-driven development tool that prevents unpredictable AI outputs by ensuring humans and AI align on detailed specifications before any code changes. It maintains "truth" specifications in `openspec/specs/` and proposed changes in `openspec/changes/`. Qwen Code is naturally compatible with OpenSpec through AGENTS.md support for natural language integration.

**Workflow Integration:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Install OpenSpec globally: `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`
   - Initialize in project: `openspec init`
   - This creates the `openspec/` directory structure in the project root

2. **Spec Phase:**
   - Create detailed specifications using `openspec draft` or `openspec show`
   - Review and validate changes with `openspec validate`
   - Specifications define exactly what needs to be implemented

3. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Qwen Code reads specifications from `openspec/changes/` 
   - AI implements tasks according to spec constraints
   - Reduces scope creep through explicit requirements

4. **Review Phase:**
   - Archive completed changes: `openspec archive`
   - Compare against original specifications for quality assurance

5. **Integration with Qwen Code CLI:**
   - New command: `/openspec` to interact with OpenSpec features
   - Automatic spec reading before major code changes
   - Workflow enforcement for complex tasks

**Benefits:**
- Deterministic AI behavior through explicit specifications
- Better suited for brownfield development (evolving existing codebases)
- Improved PR handling and rebasing workflows
- Enhanced code quality through structured reviews
- Prevention of implementation drift from original intent

**Implementation Details:**
- OpenSpec CLI commands wrapped in Qwen Code interface
- Integration into core AI decision-making loop
- New UI components for spec visualization
- Build process updated to initialize OpenSpec if present
- Testing framework extended to validate against specs
