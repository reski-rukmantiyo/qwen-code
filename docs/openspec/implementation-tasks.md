# OpenSpec Implementation Status

This document outlines the technical implementation status of the OpenSpec integration in Qwen Code, including completed command implementations, file structures, and dependencies.

## Implementation Overview

The OpenSpec integration has been fully implemented in Qwen Code, providing slash commands that integrate directly with Qwen Code's command system and provide seamless integration with Qwen Code's existing workflow. All OpenSpec functionality is accessible through the `/openspec` slash command with subcommands, following the same pattern as other built-in commands like `/help`, `/agents`, and `/model`.
