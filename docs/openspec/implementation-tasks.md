# OpenSpec Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the technical tasks required to implement OpenSpec integration in Qwen Code, including command implementations, file structures, and dependencies.

## Implementation Overview

To integrate OpenSpec into Qwen Code, we need to implement slash commands that integrate directly with Qwen Code's command system and provide seamless integration with Qwen Code's existing workflow.
